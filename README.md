Analysis of a contacts among guest at a social event.


The goal of this project is to analyse a network describing the face-to-face behaviour of people during an exhibition in 2009 at the Science Gallery in Dublin. Nodes represent exhibition visitors; edges represent face-to-face interactions that were active for at least 20 seconds. The source of the dataset is http://www.sociopatterns.org/
